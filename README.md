A little archive of notebooks that helped me with deep learning

NOTE - I made/collected these notebooks from various sources and these were designed to help me study, they may not be well-documented and some of the notebooks may not work. I suggest if any of you want to learn deep learning to make your own set of notebooks designed for you. I guess you can use these as a reference but be sure to test them.
